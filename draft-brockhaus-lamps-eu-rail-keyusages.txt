1.  Introduction

   The Europe's Rail Joint Undertaking System Pillar [ERJU] will deliver
   a unified operational concept and a functional, safe and secure
   system architecture alongside with system requirements.  The
   deliverables include due consideration of cyber-security aspects,
   focused on the European railway network to which Directive 2016/797 -
   Interoperability of the rail system within the EU
   [Directive-2016_797] applies.

   The ERJU System Pillar Cyber Security Working Group makes use of an
   internal PKI to generate X.509 PKI certificates.  The certificates
   are used for the following purposes, among others:

   *  Validating signatures of general-purpose software configuration
      files.

   *  Validating signatures of trust anchor configuration files.

   *  Validating signatures of software and firmware update packages.

   *  Authenticating communication endpoints authorized for safety-
      critical communication.

   [RFC5280] specifies several key usage extensions, defined via
   KeyPurposeIds, for X.509 certificates.  Key usage extensions added to
   a certificate are meant to express intent as to the purpose of the
   named usage, for humans and for complying libraries.  In addition,
   the IANA registry "SMI Security for PKIX Extended Key Purpose"
   [RFC7299] contains additional KeyPurposeIds.  The use of the
   anyExtendedKeyUsage KeyPurposeId, as defined in Section 4.2.1.12 of
   [RFC5280], is generally considered a poor practice.  This is
   especially true for certificates, whether they are multi-purpose or
   single-purpose, within the context of EURJU System Pillar.

   If the purpose of the issued certificates is not restricted, i.e.,
   the type of operations for which a public key contained in the
   certificate can be used are not specified, those certificates could
   be used for another purpose than intended, increasing the risk of
   cross-protocol attacks.  Failure to ensure proper segregation of
   duties means that an application or system that generates the public/
   private keys and applies for a certificate to the operator
   certification authority could obtain a certificate that can be
   misused for tasks that this application or system is not entitled to
   perform.  For example, management of trust anchor is a particularly
   critical task.  A device could potentially accept a trust anchor
   configuration file signed by a service that uses a certificate with
   no EKU or with the is KeyPurposeId id-kp-codeSigning
   (Section 4.2.1.12 of [RFC5280]) or id-kp-documentSigning [RFC9336].
   A device should only accept trust anchor configuration files if the
   file is signed with a certificate that has been explicitly issued for
   this purpose.

   The KeyPurposeId id-kp-serverAuth (Section 4.2.1.12 of [RFC5280]) can
   be used to identify that the certificate is for a TLS server, and the
   KeyPurposeId id-kp-clientAuth (Section 4.2.1.12 of [RFC5280]) can be
   used to identify that the certificate is for a TLS client.  However,
   there are currently no KeyPurposeIds for usage with X.509
   certificates in EURJU documents for safety-critical communication.

   This document addresses the above problems by defining the EKU
   extension of X.509 public key certificates.  Certificates are either
   used for signing files (general-purpose configuration and trust
   anchor configuration files, software and firmware update packages) or
   are used for safety-critical communication.

   Vendor-defined KeyPurposeIds used within a PKI governed by the vendor
   or a group of vendors typically do not pose interoperability
   concerns, as non-critical extensions can be safely ignored if
   unrecognized.  However, using or misusing KeyPurposeIds outside of
   their intended vendor-controlled environment can lead to
   interoperability issues.  Therefore, it is advisable not to rely on
   vendor-defined KeyPurposeIds.  Instead, the specification defines
   standard KeyPurposeIds to ensure interoperability across various
   implementations.

   Although the specification focuses on the the use within ERJU
   documents, the standard KeyPurposeIds defined in this document can be
   used in other deployments.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Extended Key Purpose for ERJU System Pillar

   This specification defines the KeyPurposeIds id-kp-configSigning, id-
   kp-trustanchorSigning, id-kp-updateSigning, and id-kp-
   safetyCommunication and uses these, respectively, for: signing
   general-purpose or trust anchor configuration files, or signing
   software or firmware update packages, or authenticating communication
   peers for safety-critical communication.  As described in
   Section 4.2.1.12 of [RFC5280], "[i]f the [extended key usage]
   extension is present, then the certificate MUST only be used for one
   of the purposes indicated" and "[i]f multiple [key] purposes are
   indicated the application need not recognize all purposes indicated,
   as long as the intended purpose is present".

   Systems or applications that verify the signature of a general-
   purpose or trust anchor configuration file, the signature of a
   software or firmware update package, or the authentication of a
   communication peer for safety-critical communication SHOULD require
   that corresponding KeyPurposeIds be specified by the EKU extension.
   If the certificate requester knows the certificate users are mandated
   to use these KeyPurposeIds, it MUST enforce their inclusion.
   Additionally, such a certificate requester MUST ensure that the
   KeyUsage extension be set to digitalSignature or nonRepudiation (also
   designated as contentCommitment) for signature verification and/or to
   keyEncipherment for secret key encryption.

4.  Including the Extended Key Purpose in Certificates

   [RFC5280] specifies the EKU X.509 certificate extension for use on
   end entity certificates.  The extension indicates one or more
   purposes for which the certified public key is valid.  The EKU
   extension can be used in conjunction with the Key Usage (KU)
   extension, which indicates the set of basic cryptographic operations
   for which the certified key may be used.  The EKU extension syntax is
   repeated here for convenience:

   ExtKeyUsageSyntax  ::=  SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF KeyPurposeId

   KeyPurposeId  ::=  OBJECT IDENTIFIER

   As described in [RFC5280], the EKU extension may, at the option of
   the certificate issuer, be either critical or non-critical.  The
   inclusion of KeyPurposeIds id-kp-configSigning, id-kp-
   trustanchorSigning, id-kp-updateSigning, and id-kp-
   safetyCommunication in a certificate indicates that the public key
   encoded in the certificate has been certified for the following
   usages:

   *  id-kp-configSigning

      A public key contained in a certificate containing the
      KeyPurposeId id-kp-configSigning may be used for verifying
      signatures of general-purpose configuration files (for example XML
      or JSON files).  Configuration files are used to configure
      software.  The KU extension is set to digitalSignature or
      nonRepudiation.

   *  id-kp-trustanchorSigning

      A public key contained in a certificate containing the
      KeyPurposeId id-kp-trustanchorSigning may be used for verifying
      signatures of trust anchor configuration files.  Trust anchor
      configuration files are used to add or remove trust anchors to the
      trust store of a device.  The KU extension is set to
      digitalSignature or nonRepudiation.

   *  id-kp-updateSigning

      A public key contained in a certificate containing the
      KeyPurposeId id-kp-updateSigning may be used for verifying
      signatures of software or firmware update packages.  Update
      packages are used to install software (including firmware, safety-
      related applications and others) on systems.  The KU extension is
      set to digitalSignature or nonRepudiation.

   *  id-kp-safetyCommunication

      A public key contained in a certificate containing the
      KeyPurposeId id-kp-safetyCommunication may be used to authenticate
      a communication peer for safety-critical communication based on
      TLS or other protocols.  Depending on the key type used, the KU is
      set to digitalSignature or keyEncipherment.

   id-kp  OBJECT IDENTIFIER  ::=
       { iso(1) identified-organization(3) dod(6) internet(1)
         security(5) mechanisms(5) pkix(7) 3 }

   id-kp-configSigning        OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-kp TBD2 }
   id-kp-trustanchorSigning   OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-kp TBD3 }
   id-kp-updateSigning        OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-kp TBD4 }
   id-kp-safetyCommunication  OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-kp TBD5 }

5.  Implications for a Certification Authority

   The procedures and practices employed by a certification authority
   MUST ensure that the correct values for the EKU extension as well as
   the KU extension are inserted in each certificate that is issued.
   The inclusion of the id-kp-configSigning, id-kp-trustanchorSigning,
   id-kp-updateSigning, and id-kp-safetyCommunication KeyPurposeIds does
   not preclude the inclusion of other KeyPurposeIds.

6.  Security Considerations

   The Security Considerations of [RFC5280] are applicable to this
   document.  This extended key purpose does not introduce new security
   risks but instead reduces existing security risks by providing the
   means to identify if the certificate is generated to verify the
   signature of a general-purpose or trust anchor configuration file,
   the signature of a software or firmware update package, or the
   authentication of a communication peer for safety-critical
   communication.

   To reduce the risk of specific cross-protocol attacks, the relying
   party or the relying party software may additionally prohibit use of
   specific combinations of KeyPurposeIds.  The procedure for allowing
   or disallowing combinations of KeyPurposeIds using Excluded
   KeyPurposeId and Permitted KeyPurposeId, as carried out by a relying
   party, is defined in Section 4 of [RFC9336].  Examples of Excluded
   KeyPurposeIds include the presence of the anyExtendedKeyUsage
   KeyPurposeId or the complete absence of the EKU extension in a
   certificate.  Examples of Permitted KeyPurposeIds include the
   presence of id-kp-configSigning, id-kp-trustanchorSigning, id-kp-
   updateSigning, and id-kp-safetyCommunication KeyPurposeIds.

7.  Privacy Considerations

   In some security protocols, such as TLS 1.2 [RFC5246], certificates
   are exchanged in the clear.  In other security protocols, such as TLS
   1.3 [RFC8446], the certificates are encrypted.  The inclusion of the
   EKU extension can help an observer determine the purpose of the
   certificate.  In addition, if the certificate is issued by a public
   certification authority, the inclusion of an EKU extension can help
   an attacker to monitor the Certificate Transparency logs [RFC9162] to
   identify the purpose of the certificate.

8.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is also requested to register the following ASN.1 [X.680] module
   OID in the "SMI Security for PKIX Module Identifier" registry
   (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.0).  This OID is defined in Appendix A.
